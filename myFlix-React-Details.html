                  <h2>Overview</h2>
                  <p>
                     MyFlix React is a single-page web application that allows users to browse movies, view details,
                     and manage their favorite movies. The application was developed as part of the CareerFoundry
                     Full-Stack
                     Web Development course, demonstrating proficiency in building Angular applications with a Node.js
                     development backend. The project brief included specific requirements for the UI, user
                     authentication, and data management, which were implemented using Angular components, services,
                     and routing.

                  <h2>Purpose & Context</h2>
                  <p>Movie streaming platforms have become increasingly popular, offering users a vast library of films
                     and TV shows to enjoy. MyFlix Angular was designed to provide a encyclopedic, user-friendly
                     interface for
                     browsing movies, viewing details, and managing favorites. The application serves as a showcase of
                     Angular development skills, demonstrating the ability to create responsive, interactive web
                     applications with dynamic content and user authentication.</p>

                     about each movie, including the director, genre, and release date.</li>
                  <li class="case-study-card_list"><strong>Manage Favorites</strong>: Add and remove movies from a
                     personal favorites list.</li>
                  <li class="case-study-card_list"><strong>Search Movies</strong>: Search for movies by title or genre
                     using a search bar.</li>

               <h1>Technology Stack Decisions</h1>
               <p>The Project Brief required the use of a MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) for the
                  development of the MyFlix Angular application. The following technologies were chosen to meet the
                  project requirements and demonstrate proficiency in front-end and back-end development:

                     <h3>React</h3>
                     <p>React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces that allows developers to create
                        reusable UI components and manage state efficiently. By using React in the MyFlix Angular
                        project, I was able to build a dynamic, responsive web application with a modular,
                        component-based
                        architecture. React's virtual DOM, one-way data binding, and component lifecycle methods
                        provided a powerful, efficient way to create interactive user interfaces that respond to user
                        input in real time.
                     </p>
                  </div>
                  <img src="img/react-bootstrap-logo.jpg" class="case-study-card-tech-stack-container-image"

                  <div class="tech-info">
                     <h3>React Bootstrap</h3>
                     <p>Bootstrap is a popular front-end framework for building responsive, mobile-first web
                        applications. By using React Bootstrap in the MyFlix Angular project, I was able to create
                        responsive, mobile-friendly UI components that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.
                        React
                        Bootstrap's pre-built components, grid system, and utility classes provided a flexible,
                        efficient way to design and style the application's layout, navigation, and content.

                  <div class="tech-info">
                     <h3>MongoDB, Mongoose, and Express.js</h3>
                     <p>Like the Angular version of this app, this React version uses MongoDB as the database,
                        Mongoose as
                        the ODM, and Express.js as the server framework. These technologies provide a robust,
                        scalable
                        backend architecture that supports efficient data storage, retrieval, and manipulation. By
                        leveraging MongoDB's flexible document-based data model, Mongoose's schema validation, and
                        Express.js's middleware capabilities, I was able to create a secure, reliable API for
                        managing
                        movie data and user authentication.

                     <h3>Javascript</h3>
                     <p>Javascript is a versatile, dynamic programming language that is widely used for building
                        interactive web applications. By using Javascript in the MyFlix Angular project, I was able to
                        create dynamic, responsive user interfaces that respond to user input in real time. Javascript's
                        event-driven, functional programming style provided a flexible, efficient way to handle
                        asynchronous operations, manage state, and interact with the DOM. By writing clean, modular
                        Javascript code, I was able to build a scalable, maintainable web application that showcases my
                        skills in front-end development.

               <h1>Conclusion</h1>
               <p>Developing the MyFLix React App presented different challenges from the Angular version.
                  The React version required a different approach to state management, routing, and component
                  lifecycle methods. By following the project brief and implementing specific requirements,
                  I was able to create a responsive, interactive web application that showcases my skills in
                  front-end and back-end development. The project provided an opportunity to demonstrate
                  proficiency in React development, user authentication, and data management, as well as the
                  advantages of using React, Bootstrap, and Redux in building dynamic, responsive web applications.
