         <h2>My Web Development Journey</h2>

         <p>I am transitioning to a Web Development career after two previous careers.</p>

         <h3>Pro Audio and Music</h3>

         <p>My first career began in the 90's, after receiving my Bachelor's degree in Music. During the day I
            worked
            selling
            Pro Audio Equipment Sales, working for a nationwide company called Full Compass Systems. Nights and
            weekends
            found
            me playing as a drummer and percussionist in several bands and recording projects. After college, I
            spent
            about 10
            years completely immersed in this world before deciding to make a change to better support my family.
         </p>

         <h3>Auto Mechanics</h3>

         <p>For about the past 15 years I have been an active auto mechanic. I trained at Madison College
            (Madison,
            Wisconsin)
            from 2007 to 2009, and dove in the deep end by embracing "A" level auto repair work and advanced
            diagnostics
            from
            the very beginning of my professional career. As I grew within the field, I found myself drawn to the
            electrical and
            computer side of modern vehicles. I began to specialize in advanced electrical and computer
            diagnosics. At
            Foreign
            Car Specialists, we would receive vehicles which even the dealership had given up on, and tackled the
            computer
            module replacements, wiring harness repairs, vehicle network diagnostics, vehicle programming, and
            diagnostics which
            involved combining the mechanical world with the electrical world. When interfacing between the two, I
            often
            found
            myself with an oscilloscope in hand looking directly at signal going in and out of the computers in
            order to
            fault
            trace.</p>

         <h3>Web Development</h3>

         <p>That brings me to my foray into the world of Web Development. Having grown up in the 80's, learning
            Basic on
            an
            Apple //e, then C++
            in the 90's on PC based machines, computers have always been a "hobby," much like auto repair always
            was
            from the
            moment I could pick up a wrench. I didn't come to the auto repair world without a solid foundation for
            mechanics,
            and it's a similar story with Web Development. I only recently discovered I was interested in Web
            Development when
            my best friend's son went to school
            for it. After seeing the kind of work he was doing, it seemed that a natural extension of the computer
            heavy
            work I
            was already doing with automobiles. I was totally hooked and began to seek out bootcamps, ending up
            finally
            at
            Career Foundry.</p>

         <p>Since starting the program in October of 2023, I have been absolutely smitten with this world. I can't
            get
            enough
            of it, and every day feels more like an adventure than a job or school.</p>

         <h2>Other hobbies and interests:</h2>
         <p>Single engine airplane pilot since age 17
         </p>
         <p>Powered Paragliding pilot - PPG2 rated as of April of 2023
         </p>
         <p>Homebuilt airplane - constructed a kit airplane from 2003 to 2006 and flew it until 2010
         </p>
         <p>Parenting - I am the proud father of a 24 year old son who is currently finishing up his Journalism
            degree
            and headed towards the Peace Corps after graduation
