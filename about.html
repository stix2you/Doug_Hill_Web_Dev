         <h2>My Web Development Journey</h2>

         <h3>Career Foundry</h3>

         <p>After two rewarding careers in Auto Mechanics and Pro Audio Sales, I have decided to return to one of
            my first loves: computers. If I'm honest, that was where I spent most of the time when I was a kid.
            Having grown up in the 80's, learning Basic on an Apple //e, then C++ in the 90's on PC based machines,
            computers have always been a hobby, much like auto repair always was from the moment I could pick up a
            wrench.
            <br><br>
            I didn't come to the auto repair world without a solid foundation for mechanics, and it's a similar story
            with
            Web Development. When I was younger, I was always the one pulling apart the games and programs I was using,
            trying to figure out how they worked on a software side. I spent a great deal of time helping my friend
            with her LAN, which she installed in her house in the 90's in order to practice for her day job doing IT
            at an accounting firm. As a teenager, I spent many hours coding in Basic and trying to get programs to work,
            and hung around with like minded friends who were also into computers.
            <br><br>
            This is why I know my skills as an Auto Mechanic will translate well into Web Development. In Mechanics I
            was
            always drawn to the electrical and computer side of modern vehicles, and I began to specialize in advanced
            vehicle diagnostics, using oscilloscopes and other tools to trace signals in and out of the computers in the
            vehicles. I was always the one who was called upon to diagnose the most difficult problems, and I was always
            the one who was able to solve them. I guess it's no surprise that the computer side of vehicles spoke to me
            so strongly, as they are essentially several different computers linked together with three to five networks
            (Including an optical network in many cars now).
            <br><br>
            After some careful research on bootcamps, I came across Career Foundry. I have been impressed with how much
            they push their students to learn, and how much they expect from them. It speaks to my desire to push myself
            to learn as much as I can, and to be the best I can be.
            <br><br>
         </p>

         <h3>Auto Mechanics</h3>

         <p>For about the past 15 years I have been an active auto mechanic. I trained at Madison College
            (Madison,
            Wisconsin)
            from 2007 to 2009, and dove in the deep end by embracing "A" level auto repair work and advanced
            diagnostics
            from
            the very beginning of my professional career.
            <br><br>

            The mechanical part of the work was not as challenging,
            and so as I progressed and grew within the field, I found myself drawn to the
            electrical and
            computer side of modern vehicles. I began to specialize in advanced electrical and computer
            diagnosics. At
            Foreign
            Car Specialists, we would receive vehicles which even the dealership had given up on, and tackled the
            computer
            module replacements, wiring harness repairs, vehicle network diagnostics, vehicle programming, and
            diagnostics which
            involved combining the mechanical world with the electrical world. When interfacing between the two, I
            often
            found
            myself with an oscilloscope in hand looking directly at signal going in and out of the computers in
            order to
            fault
            trace. Some of my favorite diagnostics involved the use of pressure transducers, to scope a pattern
            which showed exactly how an individual cylinder was moving air in and out of it.
            <br><br>
            As time went on, the workflow at the shop became problematic to track, and so I developed a tracking system
            and
            a parts inventory system using just spreadsheets and Quickbooks. But it was every bit as effective as costly
            management software. That project in itself showed me I could benefit from getting into API's and databases,
            to be able to design a more efficient system and one that could be customer tailored to a shop. The
            challenges
            of managing the business were attractive to me, beyond the challenges of fixing cars. And I enjoyed
            developing computer based solutions to manage the workflow, parts integration into the workflow, inventory
            control, and communications.
            <br><br>
            I continue to work on cars to make money on the side, and I still enjoy mechanics.
         </p>

         <h3>Pro Audio and Music</h3>

         <p>My first career began in the 90's, after receiving my Bachelor's degree in Music. During the day I
            worked
            selling
            Pro Audio Equipment Sales, working for a nationwide company called Full Compass Systems. Nights and
            weekends
            found
            me playing as a drummer and percussionist in several bands and recording projects. After college, I
            spent
            about 10
            years completely immersed in this world before deciding to make a change to better support my family.
            <br><br>
            During this time however, again I found I gravitated to the computer side of the business. My last six
            months
            at Full Compass Systems found me managing web sales. Back in 2004, the web was still a new frontier for
            sales, and so we did little more than sell on eBay and Amazon. But it did give me insight into the potential
            of the web for sales, and I began to see the potential for the web to be a powerful tool for business. I
            also
            developed the workflow for web sales, and managed that along with customer communications.
         </p>

         <h3>Captioning for the Hearing Impaired</h3>

         <p>In an effort to supplement my income, for about 10 years I worked for a company who produced a phone which
            provided real time captions to their clients, directly on the telephone. It was part time, and I was mostly
            a captionist, using programs like ViaVoice and Dragon to produce captions along with a keyboard and macros.
            <br><br>
            However, I was often pulled off the phones to assist in training and quality control. I was one of several
            people who helped to transition captionists from training to on-the-floor captioning, which took about a
            week of
            sit-behind monitoring and coaching. I also helped to monitor calls and provide feedback to captionists, in
            order
            to improve captions. Working closely with managers and the training team over the course of the 10 years I
            was
            there, I learned a great deal about managing and training people.
