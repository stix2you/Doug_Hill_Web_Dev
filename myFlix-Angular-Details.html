                  <h2>Overview</h2>
                  <p>
                     MyFlix Angular is a single-page web application that allows users to browse movies, view details,
                     and manage their favorite movies. The application was developed as part of the CareerFoundry
                     Full-Stack
                     Web Development course, demonstrating proficiency in building Angular applications with a Node.js
                     development backend. The project brief included specific requirements for the UI, user
                     authentication, and data management, which were implemented using Angular components, services,
                     and routing.

                  <h2>Purpose & Context</h2>
                  <p>Movie streaming platforms have become increasingly popular, offering users a vast library of films
                     and TV shows to enjoy. MyFlix Angular was designed to provide a encyclopedic, user-friendly
                     interface for
                     browsing movies, viewing details, and managing favorites. The application serves as a showcase of
                     Angular development skills, demonstrating the ability to create responsive, interactive web
                     applications with dynamic content and user authentication.</p>

               <h1>Technology Stack Decisions</h1>
               <p>The Project Brief required the use of a MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js) for the
                  development of the MyFlix Angular application. The decision to use Angular as the front-end framework
                  was based on its robust features, including component-based architecture, two-way data binding, and
                  dependency injection. Angular's built-in routing and HTTP client modules also made it an ideal choice
                  for managing application state and handling API requests.</p>
               </p>

                  <div class="tech-info">
                     <h3>Angular</h3>
                     <p>Angular is a powerful front-end framework that provides a comprehensive set of tools for
                        building
                        dynamic web applications. Its component-based architecture, two-way data binding, and dependency
                        injection make it an ideal choice for creating interactive, responsive user interfaces.
                        Angular's
                        built-in routing and HTTP client modules simplify state management and API integration, enabling
                        seamless communication between the front-end and back-end.</p>

                  <div class="tech-info">
                     <h3>Material Design</h3>
                     <p>Material Design is a design language developed by Google that emphasizes clean, intuitive
                        interfaces and consistent user experiences. By incorporating Material Design principles into
                        the
                        MyFlix Angular application, I was able to create a visually appealing, user-friendly
                        interface
                        that adheres to best practices for usability and accessibility.</p>

                  <div class="tech-info">
                     <h3>MongoDB, Mongoose, and Express.js</h3>
                     <p>Like the React version of this app, the Angular version uses MongoDB as the database,
                        Mongoose as
                        the ODM, and Express.js as the server framework. These technologies provide a robust,
                        scalable
                        backend architecture that supports efficient data storage, retrieval, and manipulation. By
                        leveraging MongoDB's flexible document-based data model, Mongoose's schema validation, and
                        Express.js's middleware capabilities, I was able to create a secure, reliable API for
                        managing
                        movie data and user authentication.</p>

                     </p>
                     <h3>Typescript</h3>
                     <p>Typescript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other advanced features to
                        improve code quality and maintainability. By using Typescript in the MyFlix Angular project,
                        I was
                        able to catch errors early, enhance code readability, and leverage advanced language features
                        like
                        interfaces, generics, and decorators. Typescript's strict type checking and compile-time
                        error
                        detection helped me write more robust, maintainable code and avoid common pitfalls in Angular
                        development.</p>

                  <div class="tech-info">
                     <h3>RXJS</h3>
                     <p>RXJS is a powerful library that is a part of Typescript and Angular. It is used to handle
                        asynchronous operations and events in a reactive, functional programming style. By using RXJS
                        in
                        the MyFlix Angular project, I was able to manage complex data flows, handle asynchronous
                        operations, and create responsive, interactive user interfaces. RXJS's observables,
                        operators, and
                        subjects provided a flexible, composable way to work with asynchronous data streams, enabling
                        me to
                        build efficient, scalable applications that respond to user input in real time.</p>

               <h1>Conclusion</h1>
               <p>Developing the MyFLix Angular App was a challenging yet rewarding experience that allowed me to
                  demonstrate my proficiency in Angular development, user authentication, and data management. By
                  following the project brief and implementing specific requirements, I was able to create a responsive,
                  interactive web application that showcases my skills in front-end and back-end development.</p>
