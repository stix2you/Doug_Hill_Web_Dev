                  <h2>Overview</h2>
                  <p>
                     MyFlix API is a RESTful web service that provides movie data to the MyFlix Angular application.
                     The API is built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, and it allows users to access information
                     about movies, directors, and genres. The API supports user authentication, enabling users to
                     register, log in, and manage their favorites list. By interacting with the MyFlix API, the
                     MyFlix Angular application can display a list of movies, allow users to view movie details,
                     and manage their favorites.
                  </p>

                  <h2>Purpose & Context</h2>
                  <p>The need to build a RESTful web service that provides movie data to the MyFlix Angular and React
                     applications arose from the desire to learn how to create a responsive, interactive web application
                     that allows users to browse, search, and manage movie information. By developing the MyFlix API,
                     I was able to demonstrate my proficiency in back-end development, user authentication, and data
                     management. The API serves as the foundation for the MyFlix Angular application, enabling users to
                     access movie data and personalize their viewing experience.</p>

               <h2>Objective</h2>
               <p>The goal of the MyFlix
                  API project was to create a RESTful web service that provides movie data to the MyFlix Angular
                  application. The API needed to support user authentication, enabling users to register, log in, and
                  manage their favorites list. By interacting with the MyFlix API, the MyFlix Angular application can
                  display a list of movies, allow users to view movie details, and manage their favorites. The API
                  needed to be secure, scalable, and efficient, supporting CRUD operations for movie data and user
                  authentication.</p>
               </p>
               <ul>
                  <li>Build a RESTful web service using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB</li>
                  <li>Implement user authentication with JWT tokens</li>
                  <li>Support CRUD operations for movie data and user favorites</li>
                  <li>Secure API endpoints with middleware and error handling</li>
                  <li>Deploy the API to a cloud platform like Heroku or MongoDB Atlas</li>
            </li>

               <h1>Technology Stack Decisions</h1>
               <p>The Project Brief required the use of specific technologies to build the MyFlix API. Here are the
                  technology stack decisions I made for the project:</p>

                  <div class="tech-info">
                     <h3>MongoDB</h3>
                     <p>MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. By using MongoDB
                        as the database for the MyFlix API, I was able to store movie data, user information, and
                        favorites in a scalable, efficient manner. MongoDB's document-based data model allowed me to
                        store complex data structures, perform fast queries, and scale horizontally as needed. By
                        leveraging MongoDB's aggregation framework, indexing, and sharding capabilities, I was able to
                        create a robust, high-performance database for managing movie data and user authentication.

                  <div class="tech-info">
                     <h3>Mongoose</h3>
                     <p>Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB that provides a schema-based
                        solution to model application data. By using Mongoose in the MyFlix API project, I was able to
                        define data schemas, validate data, and interact with MongoDB in a more structured, efficient
                        way. Mongoose's schema validation, middleware hooks, and query building capabilities helped me
                        create a secure, reliable API that enforces data integrity, handles complex data operations, and
                        integrates with Express.js seamlessly.

                  <div class="tech-info">
                     <h3>Node.js, Express.js</h3>
                     <p>Node.js and Express.js are a powerful combination for building fast, scalable web applications.
                        By using Node.js as the runtime environment and Express.js as the web application framework, I
                        was able to create a RESTful API that handles HTTP requests, routes, and middleware efficiently.
                        Node.js's event-driven, non-blocking I/O model and Express.js's minimalist, flexible design
                        enabled me to build a lightweight, high-performance API that serves movie data, user
                        authentication, and favorites. By leveraging Node.js's ecosystem of modules and Express.js's
                        middleware, routing, and error handling, I was able to create a secure, efficient API that
                        interacts with MongoDB and supports CRUD operations for movie data and user favorites.

                     <h3>REST Architecture</h3>
                     <p>REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked
                        applications that use HTTP methods to perform CRUD operations on resources. By following REST
                        principles in the MyFlix API project, I was able to create a scalable, stateless web service
                        that
                        exposes movie data, user information, and favorites as resources. RESTful endpoints were
                        designed
                        to support CRUD operations for movie data and user favorites, enabling clients to interact with
                        the API using standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. By following RESTful
                        conventions for resource naming, URL structure, and response formats, I was able to create a
                        predictable, easy-to-use API that conforms to industry best practices and standards.

                     <h3>Passport</h3>
                     <p>Passport is an authentication middleware for Node.js that provides a simple, flexible way to
                        authenticate users. By using Passport in the MyFlix API project, I was able to implement user
                        authentication with JWT tokens, enabling users to register, log in, and manage their favorites.
                        Passport's strategy-based authentication, session management, and error handling capabilities
                        helped me create a secure, reliable API that authenticates users, protects routes, and manages
                        user sessions. By leveraging Passport's local strategy, JWT strategy, and middleware functions,
                        I
                        was able to create a scalable, efficient API that enforces user authentication, handles user
                        sessions, and integrates with Express.js seamlessly.

               <h1>Conclusion</h1>
               <p>Developing the MyFlix API project was a rewarding experience that allowed me to demonstrate my
                  proficiency in back-end development, user authentication, and data management. By building a RESTful
                  web service that provides movie data to the MyFlix Angular application, I was able to showcase my
                  skills in Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. The API supports user authentication, enabling users to
                  register, log in, and manage their favorites list. By interacting with the MyFlix API, the MyFlix
                  Angular application can display a list of movies, allow users to view movie details, and manage their
                  favorites. The API is secure, scalable, and efficient, supporting CRUD operations for movie data and
                  user authentication. By deploying the API to a cloud platform like Heroku or MongoDB Atlas, I was able
                  to create a production-ready web service that provides movie data to the MyFlix Angular application.
