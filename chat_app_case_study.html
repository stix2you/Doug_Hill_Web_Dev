                  <h2>Overview</h2>
                  <p>
                     The ChatApp is a native mobile chat application, built using React Native, Expo, and Google
                     Firestore.
                     It features a streamlined chat interface that allows users to easily share messages, images, and
                     location
                     data with friends and family. Asynchronous offline storage keeps the app usable while offline, and
                     a
                     real-time Firebase/Firestore database on the server side makes for lightning fast and consistent
                     functionality
                     while online.

               <div class="descr">
                  The first step in creating the ChatApp was setting up the development environment with React Native
                  and Expo.<br><br> I structured the app by creating two key components: Start.js for the
                  start screen and Chat.js for the chat screen. <br><br>With navigation handled by React Navigation, I
                  implemented
                  user input and background color customization before testing the basic functionality on both Android
                  and
                  iOS. <br><br>The project was then committed to GitHub and recorded for documentation purposes.

               <div class="title"></div>
               <div class="descr">
                  The second step involved incorporating the Gifted Chat library into the chat screen. I imported and
                  rendered a GiftedChat component in Chat.js, managing the messages state with useState() and adding
                  initial static messages via useEffect(). <br><br>To ensure a smooth user experience, I used
                  KeyboardAvoidingView
                  for both Android and iOS, preventing the keyboard from covering the input field. <br><br>After
                  thoroughly
                  commenting on the code, I updated the GitHub repository to document the progress.

               <div class="title"></div>
               <div class="descr">
                  The next step was to integrate Firebase and Firestore for authentication and message storage. I
                  created a
                  new Firestore database, updated its read and write rules, and enabled anonymous sign-in. <br><br>After
                  installing
                  firebase, I initialized Firebase and Firestore in App.js, passing the database object to the
                  chat
                  component.
                  In Start.js, I implemented anonymous user login with signInAnonymously(), passing the user ID, name,
                  and
                  background color to the chat screen upon successful login. <br><br>In Chat.js, I used the Firestore
                  onSnapshot()
                  listener to fetch messages in real-time, ensuring messages were sorted by createdAt in descending
                  order.
                  I updated the onSend() function to save new messages directly to Firestore using addDoc().
                  <br><br>Again, I pushed everything to GitHub, then tested and recorded the app's behavior for
                  documentation.

               <div class="date">Real-Time Network Connectivity</div>
               <div class="title"></div>
               <div class="descr">
                  The next step in the process was implementing a real-time network connectivity detection system and
                  managing offline message storage. Using useNetInfo() to monitor network status, I wrote functions to
                  toggle network status and passed that information in a prop to Chat.js, allowing the chat screen to
                  adapt its data source
                  based on connectivity.
                  <br><br>In Chat.js, messages were fetched from Firestore if the connection was present, and local
                  storage if not. Additionally, the input toolbar was disabled in offline mode to prevent users from
                  composing messages or sending images.

                  <br><br>Testing the app in both online and offline modes was crucial to ensure seamless functionality.
                  Expo and Android Studio, as well a several handheld devices, were used in this phase to ensure
                  functionality. <br><br>Finally, I documented the
                  project, updated the GitHub repository, and recorded a demonstration showcasing the app's behavior in
                  offline mode. The recording illustrated message retrieval from AsyncStorage and the absence of the
                  input
                  toolbar, effectively demonstrating the implemented offline functionality.

               <div class="descr">
                  The final stage of the ChatApp project focused on implementing advanced communication features and
                  refining the documentation. <br><br>I enhanced the chat screen by adding a button that opened a custom
                  action
                  sheet, allowing users to select an image from the library, take a photo, or share their current
                  location.
                  By connecting the app to Firebase Storage, images and location data could be securely uploaded and
                  retrieved.
                  <br><br>I created the custom action sheet through a new CustomActions.js component, integrated with
                  GiftedChat
                  to
                  handle image picking, camera usage, and geolocation sharing. I also customized the chat's message
                  bubbles
                  to display maps for location messages.
                  <br><br>After thoroughly testing these features and ensuring accessibility, I updated the GitHub
                  repository
                  and
                  documented the app's setup in a comprehensive README.md file. The documentation included step-by-step
                  instructions for setting up the development environment, configuring the database, and installing
                  necessary libraries.

               <h1>Conclusion</h1>
               <p>Developing the ChatApp presented a range of challenges and valuable learning experiences. One of the
                  most
                  significant challenges was implementing seamless real-time messaging and offline functionality using
                  Firebase
                  Firestore. Coordinating Firestore synchronization with AsyncStorage to maintain a consistent chat
                  experience
                  required careful management of the network status and message caching mechanisms.</p>
               <p>Another challenge was incorporating various media-sharing features, particularly managing permissions
                  for
                  accessing the device's camera, image library, and location services. Ensuring a smooth user experience
                  involved
                  not only adhering to React Native's permissions requirements but also carefully structuring custom
                  action
                  sheets to deliver a polished user interface.</p>
               <p>Despite these challenges, the project was a valuable learning journey. I learned how to effectively
                  use
                  React-Native as a platform, Firebase and Firestore as backend services, and GiftedChat as a
                  third-party
                  library. I also gained insights into implementing advanced features for media sharing, enhancing
                  accessibility
                  through throughtful UI design, and modularizing components for reusability.</p>
               Firebase and Firestore, utilize anonymous authorization of users, enhance accessibility features, and
               implement
               modular, reusable components.
               Utilizing GiftedChat provided insight into integrating third-party libraries and customizing them to fit
               specific requirements.</p>

                     push the envelope, I am always thinking of new features to implement, such as Chat Channels,
                     Contact Lists, and Push Notifications to expand usability. However, it is also important to keep
                     focus on present tasks and not get sidetracked.</li>

                     features like media-sharing
                     and
                     geolocation into smaller, more focused components would have streamlined development and improved
                     code
                     readability.</li>
                  <li class="case-study-card_list"><strong>Expand Testing Strategy</strong>: Incorporate automated tests
                     for critical features like
                     message
                     sending, media sharing, and offline behavior to catch bugs earlier and ensure consistent
                     functionality.

               <p>Overall, the ChatApp project showcased the power of React Native for cross-platform mobile development
                  and
                  solidified my understanding of Firebase's comprehensive backend services. Moving forward, I'll carry
                  these
                  lessons into future projects, refining my development workflow and continuing to build intuitive,
                  user-friendly
                  applications.</p>
